Importance of Image Encryption and Decryption in Cyber-Security
Image encryption and decryption play a vital role in protecting visual data from unauthorized access, tampering, and exploitation. With the increasing use of images in various applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, and social media, the need for secure image transmission and storage has become more pressing.

Reasons for Image Encryption
1. Confidentiality: Protect sensitive visual data from unauthorized access.
2. Authenticity: Verify the integrity and authenticity of images.
3. Data Protection: Prevent image tampering, alteration, or exploitation.

How Image Encryption and Decryption Help
1. Secure Transmission: Encrypt images before transmitting them over insecure channels.
2. Secure Storage: Store encrypted images to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Image Integrity: Decrypt images to verify their integrity and authenticity.
